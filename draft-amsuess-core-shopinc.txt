                          Short Paths in CoAP
                   draft-amsuess-core-shopinc-latest

Abstract

   Applications built on CoAP face a conflict between the technical need
   for short message sizes and the interoperability requirement of
   following BCP190 and thus registering (relatively verbose) well-known
   URI paths.  This document introduces an option that allows expressing
   well-known paths in as little as two bytes.

1.  Introduction

   [ This is a -00, please read the abstract. ]

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes basic familiarity with CoAP ([RFC7252]), in
   particular its Uri-* options.

2.  The Short-Uri-Path option

   The Short-Uri-Path option expresses a request's URI path in a more
   compact form.

   The Short-Uri-Path option represents a particular path, and is thus
   equivalent to any number of Uri-Path options.  Those paths are
   typically in a "/.well-known" location as described in [RFC8615].
   The option values are coordinated by IANA in the Short-Uri-Path
   registry established in this document.

   A client may use the option instead of the Uri-Path option if there
   is a suitable value that can express the requested path.  Unless the
   client can be assured that the server supports it (e.g. because the
   specification describing the interaction mandates support for the
   option in the server) it SHOULD fall back to sending the path
   explicitly if it receives an error indicating that the option was not
   understood (otherwise, it would have limited interoperability).

   A server receiving the option with an unknown value MUST treat it as
   an unprocessable critical option, returning 4.02 Bad Option and MUST
   NOT return a 4.04 Not Found response, because the equivalent path may
   be present on the server.

   A server that supports a Short-Uri-Path value MUST also support the
   equivalent request composed of Uri-Path components.

        Table 1: Short-Uri-Path Option Summary (C = Critical, U =
                 Unsafe, N = NoCacheKey, R = Repeatable)


   // RFC-Editor: This document uses the CPA (code point allocation)
   // convention described in [I-D.bormann-cbor-draft-numbers].  For
   // each usage of the term "CPA", please remove the prefix "CPA" from
   // the indicated value and replace the residue with the value
   // assigned by IANA; perform an analogous substitution for all other
   // occurrences of the prefix "CPA" in the document.  Finally, please
   // remove this note.

   The Short-Uri-Path option has an integer value in its first
   occurrence; the type of later occurrences differs depending on the
   first.  It is a critical and safe-to-forward option that is part of
   the cache key, used in CoAP requests.  Table 1 summarizes these,
   extending Table 4 of [RFC7252]).  Its OSCORE treatment is as Class E
   ([RFC8613]).

   Apart from the format, these properties only deviate from the Uri-
   Path (for which it stands in) in that this option is safe to forward.
   This has unfortunate consequences for the interactions with the
   Proxy-URI option, but is generally desirable: It allows the option to
   be used with proxies that do not implement the option.

   A proxy MAY expand or introduce a Short-Uri-Path when forwarding a
   request, in particular for serving cached responses, as long as this
   introduces no new errors to the client.

2.1.  Interaction with other options

   The option is mutually exclusive with the Uri-Path option.  Receiving
   both options in a single request MUST be treated like the presence of
   a critical request option that could not be processed (that option
   being either the Short-Uri-Path option or the conflicting option).

   The Short-Uri-Path option MUST NOT be used in combination with the
   Proxy-Uri option (or the similar Proxy-CRI option (of
   [I-D.ietf-core-href])) by clients.  Proxies that understand Short-
   Uri-Path and convert Uri-* options into Proxy-Uri MUST expand any
   Short-Uri-Path if they know the value.

   By the (de)composition rules around Proxy-Uri, and because Short-Uri-
   Path is safe-to-forward, a proxy (being generally unaware of this
   specification) is allowed to combine the option with Proxy-Uri (or
   Proxy-CRI) when it combines the Uri-* options.  In such a combined
   message, the Uri-Path segments to which the Short-Uri-Path
   corresponds are appended to the path as if all components were
   present as individual options in the request without conflicting.
   Servers that support both Short-Uri-Path and Proxy-URI/-CRI SHOULD
   process requests accordingly.  (This is not a strict requirement, as
   there are no known implementations of proxies that actually ).

2.2.  Repeated use

   The document defining the registered value of the first Short-Uri-
   Path option may allow additional Short-Uri-Path options, Their value
   is not expanded through the Short-Uri-Path IANA registry, but
   according to rules set up in that particular registration.

   To be implementable on a wide variety of platforms, those rules
   should allow expansion into Uri-Path options in an iterative way
   (i.e., any added Short-Uri-Path option corresponds only to appended
   Uri-Path options, or cause a 4.02 Bad Option error, except if there
   are no resources at all with that prefix, in which case 4.04 Not
   Found may be used instead).

2.2.1.  Examples of rules

   Some rules anticipated to be used are:

   *  Options after the first are treated exactly like Uri-Path options.

   *  There can be only one added Short-Uri-Path option, and its opaque
      value is looked up in a table shaped like the Short-Uri-Path IANA
      registry.

2.2.2.  Considerations for choosing rules and prefixes

   It is recommended that the expansion of the first Short-Uri-Path
   option does not end with a trailing slash.  While that is a valid
   CoAP URI, any additional path segments generated by expanding
   additional Short-Uri-Path options would generated paths with interior
   double slashes, which is highly unusual and generally not intended.

2.3.  Choice of the option number

   TBD: Rephrase this to either be useful for readers of the final
   document who can thus learn how the option number namespace is
   managed, or remove before publication.

      It's already 1+1 -- we generally do try to keep even the 1+1 high
      so that later option typically paired with a low option (like
      EDHOC paired with OSCORE) can use the small delta.  In this case,
      there's a good reason (being ordered before Uri-Query) though, and
      I don't expect that any other option would need this particular
      property (especially given that this option on its own has an
      extensible value range).

3.  Initial Short-Uri-Path values

   This document registers values for the following well-known URIs:

   *  /.well-known/core

   *  /.well-known/rd (see [RFC9175])

   TBD: Ask BRSKI for a description

   For none of these, the repeated use of the option is specified; note
   that both are commonly used with Uri-Query options.

4.  Security Considerations

   Having alternative expressions for information that is input to
   policy decisions can be problematic when the mechanism performing the
   check has a different interpretation of the presented data than the
   mechanism at time of use.  That concern is not new to this document:
   Both the Proxy-Uri of [RFC7252] and the Proxy-Cri option of
   [I-D.ietf-core-href] have the same properties in that regard.  The
   appropriate behavior is for policy checkers to reject any request
   that contains critical options that is not understood; the
   application protected by the checker may provide the checker with an
   allow-list of options that it will treat as unchecked input.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  CoAP option: Short-Uri-Path

   IANA is requested to enter an one option into the CoAP Option Numbers
   registry in the CoRE Parameters group:

   *  Number: CPA13

   *  Name: Short-Uri-Path

   *  Reference: this document

5.2.  Short-Uri-Path registry

   IANA is requested to establish a new registry in the CoRE parameters
   group: Values of the first Short-Uri-Path option in a CoAP request
   correspond to a URI path according to this registry.

   The policy for adding any value is IETF Review (as described in
   [RFC8126]).  Change control for the registry follows this document's
   publication stream.  Initial values are given in Table 2.

   Entry fields are:

   *  First option value.

      An non-negative integer that can be expressed in 32 bits, unique
      within this registry.

      All positive values whose most significant bit of the most
      significant byte is 1 are reserved.

      The Python invocation python3 -c 'print("reserved" if
      (250).bit_length() % 8 == 0 else "unreserved")' can be used to
      quickly test this property for any positive number (250 in this
      example).

   *  Simple expanded path.

      This text is the URI path (starting with /) that the option, when
      present only once in a request, is expanded to.

      This field may be empty if the document describes that the option
      needs to be repeated when using this first value.

   *  Reference.

      A document that requested the allocation, and describes whether
      the option may be repeated after this first value, and how later
      values are expanded

   Reviewer instructions:

   The reviewer is instructed to be frugal with the 128 values that
   correspond to a single-vbyte value, focusing on applications that are
   expected to be useful in different constrained ecosystems.

   If the considerations of Section 2.2.2 are not followed, the reviewer
   is asked to verify with the applicant that they are deliberately
   deciding otherwise.

   The expanded path (or paths) are expected to be well-known paths at
   the time of writing, but it is up to the reviewers to exceptionally
   also admit paths that are not well-known.

   If the registration foresees updates, those should always just allow
   previously unacceptable values into new path segments, and not alter
   the semantics of previously valid expansions.

Appendix A.  Further development

   Several possible further directions are anticipated in this document,
   but not specified at this point in time; they are left for further
   documents:

   *  The mechanism of expanding one option into another option might be
      expressed using the terminology of SCHC.

      Such a generalization is not aimed for in this document; authors
      of any future document providing such a framework are encouraged
      to provide an equivalent but machine-readable explanation of the
      mechanism specified here.

   *  The registry for Short-Uri-Path values is set up such that first
      values can not have the most significant bit of the first byte
      set.

      This allows future documents to reuse the option for any CBOR
      expressions, e.g. the path component of a CRI
      [I-D.ietf-core-href].  Note that those CBOR structures can only
      use the major types 4 to 7 for the top-level item, but that
      includes all containers (arrays, maps and tags).

      Senders and recipients of this option do not need to concern
      themselves with that extension mechanism unless they implement it:
      As the first value is compared to known registry entries, any CBOR
      item contained in it will simply not match any known value.
      Should the working group decide not to use that extension point,
      the registry's policy can be relaxed to also allow values with
      that leading bit set.

   *  A future document may update this document to allow registering
      values that are allowed to use together with Uri-Path values (but
      at the time of writing, no examples are known by which such a
      design could be properly vetted).  In particular, that update
      weakens the "MUST" in Section 2.1.

   *  This option is designed to stand in for the Uri-Path option alone,
      not for any other option; this simplifies its interaction rules.

      In particular, application authors who seek to express Uri-Query
      options in a more concise or easier to process way are advised to
      avail themselves of the FETCH method introduced in [RFC8790].

Appendix B.  Open questions

   This section will be gone by the time this document is published.

   *  Do we want to enable the use of Uri-Query with this option?

      If so, we need option number 13, or put what the author regards as
      unreasonable requirements on recipients.

      In particular, the .well-known/core resource that is attractive
      for compression is commonly used with Uri-Query options, and it
      also works well for /.well-known/rd.

      The alternative is to use a higher number (still 1+1 but less
      precious), eg. 267.

   *  Is the transformation of separate options to Proxy-URI even
      _legal_ for proxies?

      If not, we can simplify the handling (and Uri-Path would _really_
      not have needed to be proxy-unsafe).

   *  This document might incentivise users to send more traffic through
      /.well-known/ paths, rather than go through discovery.  It is up
      to WG discussion to decide whether this is desirable; to not make
      this document depend on that outcome, the registration policy is
      currently "IETF Review", which is extremely strict and can be
      relaxed in a later document if the WG decides so.

   *  Do we want to add /.well-known/edhoc here, or rather fix it by
      updating the EDHOC option to also work without an OSCORE option?

      (The author prefers the latter).
